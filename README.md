Diabetes is usually classified into 2- type 1 and type 2. 

Diabetes mellitus, which is Type 2 diabetes, is a chronic condition posing significant challenges to global healthcare systems. 

The increasing prevalence of this disease demands innovative approaches for early detection and effective management. 

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques offer promising solutions for predicting diabetes.

Utilizing extensive datasets, including essential health indicators such as blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and glucose levels, machine learning models can identify patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes.


In this context, various machine learning algorithms, including :
decision trees,
random forests,
support vector machines (SVM),
and neural networks, 
have been employed to develop robust classifiers for diabetes prediction. 

Notably, algorithms such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) have shown significant potential in the prediction of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in prediabetic patients.
